Always use Context7 MCP for:
- library/framework setup
- API usage questions
- debugging errors and stack traces

Implementation:
- Prefer tools: resolve-library-id, get-library-docs
- Include doc version and links in outputs and ADRs
- If multiple libraries plausible, ask or fetch top 2 and compare

Constitution alignment:
- Follow `.specify/memory/constitution.md` v1.2.0 gates
- HITL strict start; EU-only processing; fixtures-first UI
